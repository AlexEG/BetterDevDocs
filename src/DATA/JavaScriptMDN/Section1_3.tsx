      <h1>A first splash into JavaScript</h1>

      <p>
        Now you've learned something about the theory of JavaScript and what you
        can do with it, we are going to give you an idea of what the process of
        creating a simple JavaScript program is like, by guiding you through a
        practical tutorial. Here you'll build up a simple "Guess the number"
        game, step by step.
      </p>
      <p>
        We want to set really clear expectations here: You won't be expected to
        learn JavaScript by the end of this article, or even understand all the
        code we are asking you to write. Instead, we want to give you an idea of
        how JavaScript's features work together, and what writing JavaScript
        feels like. In subsequent articles you'll revisit all the features shown
        here in a lot more detail, so don't worry if you don't understand it all
        immediately!

      <h2>Thinking like a programmer</h2>

      <p>
        One of the hardest things to learn in programming is not the syntax you
        need to learn, but how to apply it to solve real-world problems. You
        need to start thinking like a programmer — this generally involves
        looking at descriptions of what your program needs to do, working out
        what code features are needed to achieve those things, and how to make
        them work together.
      </p>
      <p>
        This requires a mixture of hard work, experience with the programming
        syntax, and practice — plus a bit of creativity. The more you code, the
        better you'll get at it. We can't promise that you'll develop
        "programmer brain" in five minutes, but we will give you plenty of
        opportunities to practice thinking like a programmer throughout the
        course.
      </p>
      <p>
        With that in mind, let's look at the example we'll be building up in
        this article, and review the general process of dissecting it into
        tangible tasks.

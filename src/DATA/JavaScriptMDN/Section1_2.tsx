      <h1>What is JavaScript?</h1>

      <p>
        Welcome to the MDN beginner's JavaScript course! In this article we will
        look at JavaScript from a high level, answering questions such as "What
        is it?" and "What can you do with it?", and making sure you are
        comfortable with JavaScript's purpose.
      </p>
      <h2>A high-level definition</h2>

      <p>
        JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to
        implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does
        more than just sit there and display static information for you to look
        at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D
        graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript
        is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of
        standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered
        in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.
